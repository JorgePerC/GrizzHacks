# GrizzHacks

we made this project thinking in unfairness. 

The reason of this game, is to create various challenges that make trivial questions appear, to show how cheating is a problem, and to show what happens in out world.

We think we can not make a better world, but at least not ignore the bad of it.

to start the game, run app.py
